# React-admin CRM

This is a demo of the [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) library for React.js. It's a CRM for a fake Web agency with a few sales. You can test it online at https://marmelab.com/react-admin-crm.

React-admin usually requires a REST/GraphQL server to provide data. In this demo however, the API is simulated by the browser (using [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest)). The source data is generated at runtime by a package called [data-generator](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/examples/data-generator).

To explore the source code, start with [src/App.js](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/examples/crm/src/App.js).

**Note**: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to run

After having cloned the react-admin repository, run the following commands at the react-admin root:

```sh
make install

make build

make run-crm
```
